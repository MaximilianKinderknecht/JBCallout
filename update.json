"NEW:\n\
- Added new dynamic Aggressive Road Rage Driver callout.\n\
- Suspect initially blends into normal traffic and escalates only after player detection.\n\
- Road rage can be triggered by proximity, sirens, or police presence.\n\
- Optional victim vehicle enables realistic road rage scenarios in live traffic.\n\
- Dynamic escalation paths including confrontation, vehicle pursuit, foot pursuit, or armed resistance.\n\
- Extremely high replay value due to unpredictable and randomized outcomes.\n\
- Versioning system updated to Major.Minor.Patch format.\n\
\n\
[ROAD RAGE DRIVER – AI & GAMEPLAY]\n\
- Integrated stress-based suspect behavior with increasing aggression.\n\
- Suspect reactions depend on player distance, siren usage, movement, and weapon status.\n\
- Added realistic road rage driving maneuvers (brake checking, cutting off vehicles, side-swiping).\n\
- Smooth transition from calm driving to aggressive and hostile behavior.\n\
- Route blip dynamically switches from vehicle tracking to on-foot suspect tracking.\n\
\n\
FIXES:\n\
- Improved stability during vehicle stops and pursuits.\n\
- Fixed edge cases when the suspect exits or re-enters vehicles.\n\
- General cleanup and safety fixes when ending the callout."
