  "changelog_en":
"NEW:\n\
- Added new dynamic Street Fight callout.\n\
- Street fights now spawn organically in open-world locations.\n\
- Multiple suspects spawn early and act independently.\n\
- Encounters dynamically evolve based on player behavior.\n\
\n\
[STREET FIGHT – AI & GAMEPLAY]\n\
- Integrated stress-based suspect behavior (escalation, fleeing, freezing).\n\
- Suspects react to player distance, movement speed, and aggression.\n\
- Visual suspect signals via SignalDirector (nervousness, agitation, panic).\n\
- Situations can escalate into foot pursuits or de-escalate through calm player actions.\n\
- No two Street Fight encounters play out the same.\n\
\n\
IMPROVEMENTS:\n\
- Improved overall suspect reaction timing and behavior consistency.\n\
\n\
FIXES:\n\
- Minor stability fixes related to suspect task handling."
