"NEW:\n\
\n\
IMPROVEMENTS:\n\
\n\
[AI CHANGES]\n\
- Suspects now react dynamically to distance, line of sight, and player behavior.\n\
- Breaking line of sight can de-escalate situations, especially with trained suspects.\n\
- Different suspect types now feel distinct and predictable.\n\
- Nervous suspects may panic-fire under extreme stress.\n\
- Professional suspects engage in controlled, targeted attacks instead of panicking.\n\
- Calm and tactical player behavior is now rewarded.\n\
\n\
FIXES:\n\
- Fixed an issue where a second clerk could sometimes spawn with unintended behavior.\n\
- Fixed a debug issue where keys F7, F8, and similar had no function for users.\n\
\n\
REMOVED:\n\
- Street Fight callout has been temporarily removed. This callout is not intended to be live at this time and will be re-added as soon as possible."
